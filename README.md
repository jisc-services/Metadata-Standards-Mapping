There is a group of established “standards” with which you are familiar:

RCUK (RIOXX)

REF plus the terminology you invented (First Compliant Deposit etc)

APCs (see CASRAI profile)

Europe: OpenAIRE (link)/Horizon 2020

There is already a RIOXX to OpenAIRE mapping

What is needed is for you to devise a web-based visualisation tool that will enable people to perceive easily how these things relate to one another.  So, for example, looking at the RIOXX AP, where are the common points with the other standards.  Have I explained myself clearly?  I’m sure you know what I’m getting at since your tube map analogy effectively achieves this.
